This project uses the [MetaMask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/) framework to extend MetaMask
capabilities to include support for Polkadot, Kusama, and other
[Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/)- and FRAME-based blockchains in the
[Polkadot](https://www.polkadot.network/) ecosystem.

## Documentation

Polkadot Wallet snap architecture, integration steps and detailed API documentation for dApp
developers is covered in the
[project wiki](https://github.com/ChainSafe/metamask-snap-polkadot/wiki), which also includes a
usage guide for the [example dApp](https://polkadot.snap.chainsafe.io/).

## Local Development

Developers who wish to use the snap locally must use [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/);
run the following commands from the project root to launch the
[Polkadot Wallet Snap Example dApp](https://github.com/ChainSafe/metamask-snap-polkadot/tree/master/packages/example).

- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn run demo`
